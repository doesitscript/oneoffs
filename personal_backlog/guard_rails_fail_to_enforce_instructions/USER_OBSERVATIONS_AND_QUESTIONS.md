# User Observations and Questions

**Purpose**: This document captures the user's observations, questions, and concerns that were documented during the incident but not explored immediately. These are items to be addressed in a later analysis session.

## Usage

When you drop this template folder into a chat to document an incident, you can include additional observations and questions in your message. The AI will:

1. **Document** these observations here without exploring them immediately
2. **Integrate** relevant points into the ANALYSIS.md and NUANCED_FACTORS.md
3. **Preserve** your questions for later analysis and resolution
