U: “Create an S3 bucket named DEVONLY-terraform-backend-until-tfe-backend-setup
S: Explained that S3 bucket names must be lowercase and globally unique, proposed the valid name 'devonly-terraform-backend-until-tfe-backend-setup', and asked for confirmation plus preferences (region, encryption type, and whether to create a DynamoDB lock table). Offered secure defaults: versioning enabled, SSE-S3 encryption, block public access, deny unencrypted puts and non-TLS, and BucketOwnerEnforced ACLs.
No file or infrastructure changes executed yet; awaiting user confirmation.

U: use aws cli and create devonly-tf-backend-temp-colab-todo-tfe-backend
S: Provided a secure AWS CLI script to create and harden the S3 bucket 'devonly-tf-backend-temp-colab-todo-tfe-backend': handles us-east-1 LocationConstraint, blocks public access, enables versioning, enforces default SSE-S3 encryption, sets BucketOwnerEnforced object ownership, and applies a bucket policy denying non-TLS and unencrypted uploads. Script auto-detects region from AWS config or uses REGION env var.
No commands executed; delivered a ready-to-run bash script for the user to run in their environment.
